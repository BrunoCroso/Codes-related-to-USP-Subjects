## The main objective of each EP (programming exercise) is listed below:

**ep02** - The objective of this exercise is to promote a first contact with the programming practice known as Object Orientation. To this end, you will first train how to use the Fraction class to write the functions HFlargest() and HFminor()

**ep03** - The objective of this exercise is to promote a first introduction to the programming practice known as Object Orientation. To this end you will implement part of a class to work with complex numbers.

**ep04** - The objective of this exercise is to continue the programming practice known as Object Orientation. Let's extend the Fraction class to strengthen our understanding of the use of special methods, this time mixing fractions with objects of type int.

**ep05** - The objective of this exercise is to discuss when to use methods and when to use functions; train pattern recognition ability; measure execution time.

**ep06** - The objective of this exercise is to continue the programming practice known as Object Orientation to apply the concepts covered so far.

**ep07** - The purpose of this exercise is to introduce the abstract type of data known as a stack. Let's take the opportunity to review the use of lists and strings in Python.

**ep08** - The objective of this exercise is to continue training in the use of the abstract stack data type. Let's take the opportunity to review the use of lists and strings in Python.

**ep09** - The objective of this exercise is to continue training the ability to think with abstract types of data, exploring the power that OOP provides us by allowing us to create new types. In this exercise we will also reinforce the use of tuples (Python's tuple type) and the concept of mutability.

**ep10** - In this exercise we will extend the Array2d class to explore the concepts of copying and viewing objects.

**ep11** - In this exercise we will start working with Numpy, a powerful Python numerical library. In this transition, we will implement some very useful new methods in linear algebra in the Array2d class and discuss how these behaviors are realized using objects from Numpy's ndarray class.

**ep12** - In this exercise we will train the use of arrays in the NumPy module.

**ep13 **- In this exercise we will extend the NPImagem class with some more methods to investigate the performance gain offered by the use of arrays.

**ep14** - Let's take a break from describing abstract data types to introduce the concept of recursion.

**ep15** - We will continue to develop recursive algorithms and learn how to make them as efficient as their iterative versions.

**ep16** - We will continue to develop recursive algorithms and learn how to make them as efficient as their iterative versions. This time, we will apply memoization using a Numpy array as a scratch pad.

**ep17** - In this exercise we will return to the topic of image processing to develop a recursive algorithm for segmenting blobs (connected regions) of an image. For simplicity, let's work directly on Numpy arrays.

**ep18** - In this exercise we will continue the topic of segmenting blobs (connected regions) of an image. To make blob manipulation easier, let's now put everything inside a Blobs class.

**ep19** - In this exercise we will study principles of algorithms by implementing and comparing the time consumption of different algorithms to solve the problem of searching for information in sequences.

**ep20** - In this and future exercises we will continue the topic of ordering lists.

**ep21** - In this exercise we will continue the topic of ordering lists.

**ep22** - In this exercise we will continue the topic of ordering lists.

**ep23** - In this exercise we will continue the topic of ordering lists.

**ep24**: In this exercise we will study a data structure, known as a heap, which is the basis of an even more sophisticated sorting algorithm known as Heapsort.

**ep25**: In this exercise we will continue to train the design and analysis of algorithms with a different problem. Let's also take the opportunity to review Python's dict (dictionary) type.

**ep26**: In this activity we will study a problem related to string comparison that has solutions with very different time consumption. We will continue to train algorithm analysis to study the behavior of these solutions and present more efficient algorithms based on memoization and dynamic programming techniques.

**ep27**: In this activity we will introduce the Monte Carlo Method. In this and the next exercises, we will simulate some simple phenomena that you may already know a solution for or even be able to develop an analytical solution for.

**ep28**: The previous activity introduced the Monte Carlo method that we can use to simulate the behavior of certain phenomena.
