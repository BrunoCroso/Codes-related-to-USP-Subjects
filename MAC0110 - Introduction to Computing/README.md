## The main objective of each EP (programming exercise) is listed below:

**ep01** - This program prompts for a string, an integer, and a real number, and then returns various values.

**ep02** - This program requests a string, an integer, and a real number, and then returns the data types resulting from various mathematical operations involving these values.

**ep03** - This program prompts for point coordinates and checks whether the point falls within the blue region of an image.

**ep04** - This program calculates the check digits for identification documents.

**ep05** - This program takes a number and verifies if it is a Pythagorean number. In other words, it checks whether there exist three numbers that can form a right triangle, with their sum equaling the provided number.

**ep06** - This program is designed to provide practice in creating functions in Python. It includes four examples.

**ep07** - This program estimates the area under certain functions based on integral calculations.

**ep08** - This program calculates the probability of a circular arrangement in a "secret friend" gift exchange, utilizing the Monte Carlo method.

**ep09** - This program transforms a regular list into a circular combination list.

**ep10** - This program corrects a DNA sequence and compares it to another one.

**ep11** - This program identifies the perfect combination of two DNA sequences.

**ep12** - This program generates quotes based on the works of Machado de Assis.

**ep13** - This program attempts to explain societal segregation by illustrating how people tend to live near others who are similar to them.
